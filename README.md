# nnlib
Very old library (2007-8?) for playing with neural networks (MLP) that I wrote while I was studying in the university. No doubt, it can be further optimized (and I know how), it contains some flaws and code that smells bad (and I know where), but my primary goal was to understand, how MLP works and how to train it.

For demonstration purposes and a good memories of mine only.
